# break_time
Python program to remind you to take a break while using computer

Use Firefox Browser with the addon R-Kiosk (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/r-kiosk/). This addon opens the firefox in full screen mode. And the video starts playing automatically in full screen. You can't just escape it from your face :)

To change the interval for break, change the function time.sleep value which is in seconds. The value of (60*20) sets 20 minute interval.

Be careful that this addon also disables all the menus within the firefox and can only be uninstalled in Safe Mode. I use don't use firefox as my regular browser and it is being used only for this break_time application. This set up forces me to take a break and the only way I can exit from this is by using Alt+F4 to quit firefox.
